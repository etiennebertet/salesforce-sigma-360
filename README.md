<h1>Project Sigma360</h1>

The Salesforce project Sigma360 is a Proof Of Concept (POC) developed inside the company Edumotiv which owns the brand Ekovya that deals office furnitures with an eco-responsible marketing position. 
Its end goal is to automate the communication with customers and facilitate the retrieval of data for better strategic decision-making.

As a Project Manager, I was in charge of plannification, cost control, and rigourous documentation. I prepared an official presentation for the project update report to be delivered every month to the board of directors, using PowerPoint, Figma, and advanced Excel sheets.

We used OpenProject to track time and cost of each task and make sure we were within the timeframe and budget.

I also participated in the configuration of the Salesforce platform, the design of the website and the automation processes connecting both.
